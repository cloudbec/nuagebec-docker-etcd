nuagebec-etcd
====================

etcd image for docker build on nuagebec/ubuntu:14.04 image

etcd, a highly-available key value store for shared configuration and service discovery.
etcd is inspired by Apache ZooKeeper and doozer, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: curl'able user facing API (HTTP+JSON)
* *Secure*: optional SSL client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 1000s of writes/s per instance
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the Raft consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

Use etcdctl for a simple command line client.
Or, feel free to just use curl, as in the example below :

Note : using ETCD discovery URL as docker env. variable is mandatory (for now)
---

A simply way to obtain this variable is using this script

```sh
#/bin/sh
# If env. var. named ETCD_DISCOVERY isn't set, discover it
if [[ -z "$ETCD_DISCOVERY" ]]
then ETCD_DISCOVERY=$(wget https://discovery.etcd.io/new  -O - ) && \
     export ETCD_DISCOVERY ; fi
```

You can use this base box standalone doing :

```bash
docker pull nuagebec/etcd:latest
docker run -d -p 4001:4001 -p 7001:7001 -env ETCD_DISCOVERY=$(wget https://discovery.etcd.io/new  -O - )   nuagebec/etcd:latest
```

or using env-file generated by gen-pub-discovery-URL.sh (erase and create new file each times) :
```sh
docker run -d -p 4001:4001 -p 7001:7001 -env-file docker_env_file   nuagebec/etcd:latest
```
